## NFT - Manager
> Royalties for Artists, Builders and Creators! 🚀


An NFT manager built on Canto network.
Great Creator's and Artist's works have gone unnoticed or have sold many times and for high prices without paying royalty to the creator and we want to prioritize creators with this project and ensure that creatives get what they deserve for bringing originality to our ecosystem.


You can create Non-Fungible tokens and trade them with NFT-manager smart contract which takes into account the creators royalty and makes sure the creator is properly rewarded for their creations.
