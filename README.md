- O Thoth, Great God of the Moon, Writing and Judgement, guide us faithfully through
- our disputes and hold us fast to our agreements. Allow us the certainty to bind and
- commit ourselves to each other, both in the ethereal and the real. With your wisdom
- and memory, we shall be sheltered from rugs, no pact shall be forgotten and no betrayer
- shall avoid @Zachbtc's unwavering gaze.

\\\\\WHAT IS THOTH?\\\\\

THOTH is crypto's first protocol that utilizes the internal cryptography in Ethereum's VM to bind 
real world parties to legally binding agreements. Launched initially on CANTO thanks to the CANTO 
Hackathon, THOTH allows two (or more) parties to bind themselves into a legal agreement that includes
terms that cannot be directly included in smart contracts because of their size, uncertainty, or 
incompatibility with the EVM.

Users can bring any contract in PDF form to THOTH to be bound. This can be provided by one party's 
lawyer, custom written by the parties, or selected from an external legal repository such as OpenLaw 
(https://www.openlaw.io/).

Ultimately, THOTH uploads the agreement to IPFS, and prompts the signatories to execute the agreement. 
Once all parties sign, the agreement is fully executed and is marked as such on chain.

<b>THOTH and its developers can provide no legal advice or opinions as to the legality of any contracts 
  agreed to and executed on THOTH. Use of and reliance of THOTH is entirely at the user's risk.</b>

THOTH's development front-end is available at <i>https://zodomo-thoth.surge.sh/ </i> or 
<i>https://thoth-ui.vercel.app/</i> depending on our mood.
